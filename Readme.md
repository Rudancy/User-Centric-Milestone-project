The Monkees

This project as the intention of show casing "The Monkees". It will do this by having several sections. The first will be an introduction to The Monkees, then followed by a bio, which will tell the user about the members of the band. This will then lead onto a gallery giving the user an opportunity to see the the band and get a feeling of the sort of people they are. next is a audio/video section. this gives the user an opportunity to experience the great music of the band. this will be followed by a form that allows the user to hire the band. Finally at the end will be links to their social media platforms.

All these combined will allow the user to experience the full spectrum of the band, visual, hearing and through the form and social media an opportunity to meet and see the band live. Also to increase the bands online coverage that will help the band spresd its name further a field thus increasing its revenues.



UX

The website is aimed at current and new users who potentialy do not know who The Monkees are or wish to find out more about the band. so to achieve this there is an introduction
that allows the user to first access this easily. In front of the user (as the website is accessed) is a full background photo of the monkees, this straight away
gives the user a good look at the band. next is the question of who the band is and how they formed, thus there is a small introduction followed by a short biography
and picture of each band member. I wanted it to be easy for everyone to access them so i used as many pictures as possible to give the feeling of them and the era 
they lived in. this can be easily accessed by all the different sections within the project.

Features

The introduction is short but insightful, thus giving the user an opportunity to get a bit of information but not enough for the user to not wnat to investigate more.

The bio allows the user to easily access the band members, the thumbnails allows the user to see each member in a familiar way.

the gallery is interatctive thus giving the user an incentive to click and take time to see each picture.

The video and audio is quiet minimalist as i wished the focus to be on the music and video

The form- hire me section, is quite bright and contrasts nthe audio/video so catches the attention of the user, bringing emphasis to this aspect.



future features 
I would include a upcoming gig list
a past gig list with anchors to youtube allowing the user to see previous gigs

Testing

I have tested extensively the different aspects of the website on different browser sizes and browser types. I have used https://validator.w3.org/nu/#cl382c109 to validate 
my code. I have used the navbar and asked other people to use the site and get feed back. you can click on the audio and video and they play as they should.
if you click on the pictures they highlight in colour. If you fill the form in in and do not put an email address in it errors. I tested the website using devtools on
chrome. I came across many interesting bugs for example the form at the bottom of the page spilt over onto the footer, i solved this through research and tutor help eventually
resolving this by taking the height property out of the css. I came across a bug whereby the navbar over-spilt from the browser when the browser was in tablet mode,
i did this by reducing the padding within the navbar and thus making the navbar smaller. 

Deployment

This project was deployed on GitHub. it was updated with each new change. This took me a while to get to grips with as i did not understand github at the start. however
after i got to grips with it i have made regular commits and pushes. The website can also be accessed through the following address

A lot of credit also has to go to the friendly, patient users of slack, who helped me with there support and advice.

 Also to the tutors of the code institute, thank you for all your help.

I recieved inspiration from the example project.
